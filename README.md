# Ruya

This is the repository for the paper which introduces Ruya, the memory-aware cluster configuration optimizer.
It will be presented at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Big Data.

It contains:

- The source code and the [evaluation](/evaluation.ipynb) of Ruya, including resulting [plots](/plots)
- The [main evaluation dataset in csv format](arrow_cluster_jobs.csv) from the ["Arrow" paper by Hsu et al.](https://github.com/oxhead/scout)
- The [local runtime data set in csv format](/local_jobs.csv) which was gathered by [Crispy](https://github.com/dos-group/crispy) during the profiling runs

The full title of the paper is _"Ruya: Memory-Aware Iterative Optimization of Cluster Configurations for Big Data Processing"_.

The authors of the paper are Jonathan Will, Lauritz Thamsen, Jonathan Bader, Dominik Scheinert, and Odej Kao.
